=============
DockerSpawner
=============

The **dockerspawner** (also known as JupyterHub Docker Spawner), enables
`JupyterHub <https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub>`_ to spawn single user
notebook servers in `Docker containers <https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container>`_.

There are three basic types of spawners available for dockerspawner:

- DockerSpawner: takes an authenticated user and spawns a notebook server
  in a Docker container for the user.
- SwarmSpawner: launches single user notebook servers as Docker Swarm mode
  services.
- SystemUserSpawner: spawns single user notebook servers
  that correspond to system users.
